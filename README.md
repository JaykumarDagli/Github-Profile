Consumer Complaint Resolution
Predict if the consumer disputed the resolution provided for a complaint.

Getting Started
Consumer complaint resolution is important to any business. In this particular case we have detailed consumer complaints along with whether consumer disputed with the conclusion. If we are able to predict this, consumer who is more likely to dispute a conclusion can be given more attention as to how the complaints are handled as well as how persuasively the final conlusions are conveyed to them. The target here is to build prediction model for column "Consumer disputed".

Algorithm
Logistic Regression with Hyperparameter tuning
